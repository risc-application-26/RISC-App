# 🌱 RISC: The Resilience Paradox

**Why we engineered a system that pays us to be fragile.**

A data-driven demonstration of how fintech tools can solve climate disaster resilience — built as an application for RISC.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**[Access the app on Streamlit Cloud →](https://risc-app-mnmqsowhrnud9lykr5kcpf.streamlit.app/)**

No installation required — explore the interactive demo directly in your browser.

## What This Is

RISC (Resilient Infrastructure & Sustainable Communities) demonstrates four product concepts that treat natural disasters as **market failures**:

- **💧 Liquidity Trigger**: Parametric disaster finance (pre-hurricane cash transfers)
- **🏚️ Risk Reveal**: Climate risk labels for real estate transactions
- **🔥 Defensible DAO**: Cryptographic proof of wildfire prevention compliance
- **🔌 Welfare Pulse**: Smart meter early warning for heat vulnerability

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run RISC-App.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Key Features

- **Interactive climate scenario builder** with 4 parameters (warming, sea level, storms, persona)
- **Live hurricane simulation** with parametric trigger logic and ROI modeling
- **Sustainability-themed design** with green infrastructure emphasis
- **Full implementation roadmap** from pilot to scale

## Important Note

**All data is synthetic and for demonstration purposes only.** Climate scenarios are informed by IPCC projections, and disaster cost modeling uses realistic parameter ranges, but this is not production-ready analytics. Real-world implementation would require peer-reviewed validation, location-specific data, and rigorous impact evaluation methodology.

**Built to demonstrate**: Product thinking, data visualization, climate adaptation strategy, and operational planning for mission-driven tech ventures.
